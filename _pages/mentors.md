### How to join CANOSP
We welcome free and open-source (FOSS) projects with public repositories to participate in CANOSP!  We require at least one Project Mentor for each participating project, but only one mentor needs to fill out the form at the bottom of this page.  Projects can participate for a single semester, a number of semesters, or on an ongoing basis.

### What to Expect as a Project Mentor

- Attend the Code Sprint
- Assign tasks to students and review their work
- Hold weekly online meetings with students
- Provide a mid-term and final evaluation for each student
- Mentor and assist students throughout the semester
