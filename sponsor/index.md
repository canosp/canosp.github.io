The **Canada Open Source Projects (CANOSP)** initiative is a Canada-wide program that brings together the top students from different universities to work on open-source projects over the course of a semester.

We host a **48-hour Code Sprint** on the third weekend of the semester where the students are flown in to Edmonton to meet their project mentors, learn about the project that they will be working on, and start developing on a starter task or issue to introduce them to the codebase. This face-to-face working time is critical for building initial rapport amongst teams, solving problems people might be having with toolchains, and explaining complex topics and technologies.

After the Code Sprint, students return to their respective institutions and continue to work on their projects under the supervision of their project mentors. Throughout the semester, they have weekly online meetings and produce three short voiced-over video walkthroughs explaining the work that they have done.

Your sponsorship will primarily go towards the Code Sprint to help us:
Pay for out-of-area students’ transportation to and from the Code Sprint
Pay for out-of-area students’ accommodations
Provide meals, non-alcoholic beverages, and snacks for students and mentors

There are four levels of sponsorship for CANOSP:

| Amount | Level | Perks |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 10,000 | Diamond | Gold + Recognition on t-shirts |
| 5,000 | Gold | Silver +  Recognition on the YouTube videos (start and end) |
| 3,000 | Silver | Bronze + Company-provided swag in bag and recognition during the code sprint |
| 1,000 | Bronze | Recognition on webpage and company-provided page in bag (e.g., company info or internship/job opportunities) |

We are very grateful for your support, which makes it possible for us to run this unique initiative to bring together students from all across Canada and give them valuable experience in distributed development, open-source software, and teamwork.
