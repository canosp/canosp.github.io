### Fall 2021 Schedule (Proposed)

This is the planned CANOSP schedule for the Fall 2021 semester. Please keep in mind that the schedule may change as required, and that projects and universities may define additional items and due dates (e.g. a university may have an earlier closing date for student applications).

The columns for Students, Project Mentors, and Faculty Mentors shows whom the list item concerns.  An 'info' item means that those affected should be aware of the item, and an 'action' item means that some action is required.
