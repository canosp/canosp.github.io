Welcome to the Canada Open Source Project (CANOSP) website!

The Canada Open Source Projects (CANOSP) initiative is a Canada-wide academic
program that connects top students from different universities to work on
open-source projects over the course of a semester. CANOSP is an excellent
opportunity for students at your institution to meet other students from
computing science programs across the country, connect with industry, learn
about open-source development, bolster their portfolios, and strengthen their
skills as successful developers and software engineers.

We aim to offer this course during Fall and Winter semesters each year in
cooperation with our project partners and sponsors. While projects and
availability may change from semester to semester, some of the partners
we have lined up include IBM, Mozilla, and Beanbag-who will provide excellent
mentors with years of seasoned industry experience to offer.
